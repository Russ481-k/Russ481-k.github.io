<h1>Project Model Improvement: Organizing Structure and Fields</h1>
<p>Hello everyone!<br>
    In previous posts, we looked at asynchronous database processing and session management integration. In this post,
    I'd like to discuss <strong>project model improvements</strong>. The data model is core to the application, and a
    well-organized model greatly helps with maintenance and scalability. Let's examine the improvement points step by
    step!</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. Why Do We Need Model Improvements?</h2>
<p>We discovered several issues while using the existing model. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Managing budget in a single field:</strong><br>
            Trying to manage budget information in one field made it difficult to utilize minimum/maximum budget values
            separately.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Field name 'metadata':</strong><br>
            Since 'metadata' is a reserved word in SQLAlchemy, using it for other purposes could risk conflicts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Reflecting new requirements:</strong><br>
            Additional information like <code>currency</code>, <code>posted_date</code>, <code>deadline</code>,
            <code>skills</code> became necessary for project information.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, we wanted to make the model more granular and clearer.</p>

<h2>2. Specific Improvements</h2>
<h3>2.1 Separating Budget Fields: budget_min &#x26; budget_max</h3>
<p>While we previously stored budget information in a single <code>budget</code> field,<br>
    we'll now manage minimum and maximum budgets as separate fields.<br>
    This allows for more precise usage in searching, filtering, and sorting.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer

class Project(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'projects'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    # Existing budget field -> split into two
    budget_min = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    budget_max = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
</code></pre>
<h3>2.2 Resolving Reserved Word Collision: metadata → project_metadata</h3>
<p>Instead of using the reserved word <code>metadata</code> in SQLAlchemy,<br>
    we'll use <code>project_metadata</code> to avoid confusion.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from sqlalchemy import Column, JSON

class Project(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'projects'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    # To resolve the reserved word problem, we'll change it
    project_metadata = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
</code></pre>
<h3>2.3 Adding New Fields</h3>
<p>To represent more detailed project information, we added several new fields.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>currency:</strong> Field representing the budget unit</li>
    <li><strong>posted_date:</strong> Field representing the project posting date</li>
    <li><strong>deadline:</strong> Field representing the project deadline</li>
    <li><strong>skills:</strong> Field representing the technical stack needed for the project</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">from sqlalchemy import Column, String, DateTime
import datetime

class Project(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'projects'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    budget_min = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    budget_max = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    project_metadata = Column(JSON, nullable=True)

    # Added new fields
    currency = Column(String, default='USD')
    posted_date = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow)
    deadline = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
    skills = Column(String, nullable=True)  # For example: "Python, JavaScript, SQL"
</code></pre>
<p>By improving the model, data is more structured and clearly managed, which will be helpful for future queries or data
    analysis.</p>

<h2>3. Benefits of Improved Model</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Clear data representation:</strong><br>
        By separating budget information into minimum/maximum values,<br>
        it is possible to search and compare various ranges.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoiding reserved word collisions:</strong><br>
        By using the clear field name <code>project_metadata</code>,<br>
        we avoided conflicts with reserved words in SQLAlchemy.</li>
    <li><strong>Extensible model:</strong><br>
        By adding additional fields,<br>
        we can represent project information more richly and flexibly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we looked at the project model improvements in detail.<br>
    Managing the database model systematically is a big influence on the long-term maintenance and performance
    improvement of the application.<br>
    In the remaining articles, we will introduce more improvements such as <strong>crawler scheduler
        implementation</strong> and <strong>encryption system introduction</strong>, so please look forward to it!</p>
<p>If you have any additional points or questions about the improvements, please leave a comment anytime. Your feedback
    is a big help!</p>

<h2>2. Project Overview</h2>
<p>[ STO Exchange "ENTASIS" ]
<img src="/images/entasis/entasis_trade.gif" alt="Trading"></p>
<p>The goal of this project is to help investors understand what STOs are, what features they have, and how to invest in them, thereby expanding investment in security tokens.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fmODCTVs0g">Larry Fink Interview</a></p>
<p>In an interview on December 1, 2022, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated that through STOs, broker fees included in current securities trading costs would be distributed to trading parties, lowering fees, and ST holders would be able to vote.</p>
<p>Larry Fink's perspective on STOs helped inform our project topic selection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSVpth7uqb4&#x26;t=650s">STO Explanation Video</a></p>
<p>The tokens we commonly know are 'utility tokens' based on ICOs.</p>
<p>So what is an STO?</p>
<p><img src="/images/entasis/entasis_sto.png" alt="STO Explanation"></p>
<p>First, we need to understand what "Security Tokens" are, which form the basis of STOs.</p>
<p>Security tokens (ST) are securities issued by companies in cryptocurrency form instead of stocks or bonds. These security tokens represent legal ownership in the company, rather than just rights to use services provided by the blockchain platform.</p>
<p>Therefore, holding security tokens allows you to receive dividends from the company's profits or blockchain platform assets.</p>
<p>Since security tokens serve the same purpose as securities like stocks and bonds, they must be subject to legal and policy regulation. They must be issued according to relevant laws, just as stocks are issued according to commercial law procedures.</p>
<p>STO refers to listing these security tokens for trading, similar to an IPO.</p>
<p><img src="/images/entasis/entasis_sto2.png" alt="STO Explanation 2"></p>
<p>[ About Service ]
Entasis is an "STO Exchange Tutorial" that helps individual investors better understand and approach security tokens by allowing them to invest in actual STs, with some features of real STO exchanges scaled down.</p>
<h2>3. Basic Environment Setup</h2>
<h3>Token Price Formation and Volatility</h3>
<p>While prices are typically formed through Market Maker &#x26; Market Taker trading in real exchanges, we implemented price formation through random numbers due to the tutorial nature of this project and limited expected traffic.</p>
<p>We created three ST markets with short-term volatility, medium-long term volatility, and company quarterly profit announcements set by random numbers. Dividends are distributed according to shareholding ratio by applying dividend rates to quarterly profits.
Token holders can vote according to their shareholding ratio.</p>
<h3>Blockchain</h3>
<p>Ethereum: We ran the Ganache network in the background on an EC2 instance and deployed contracts using Truffle.
We fundamentally used ERC20 for token trading functionality and extracted operator/controller variables and trading restriction functions from ERC1400 to add some security token features.
We deployed three contracts diversifying into three companies, as investors need to analyze and trade various tokens. When token trades occur, holder arrays store token ownership to verify dividend distribution eligibility.
All staking features were implemented within the contract to enforce trading restrictions during staking, using block.timestamp to verify expiration.</p>
<h2>4. Project Documentation</h2>

<h2>Feeling</h2>
<p>The 4-week period was meaningful in implementing volatility and market forms. Most memorable was sharing the joy of growing assets as team members shared their returns.</p>
<p>While we wanted to cover NFTs and derivatives like futures/options, time constraints left us wanting more.</p>
<p>It was valuable time learning we could implement services ourselves and identifying needed technologies.</p>
<h2>Finding</h2>
<ol>
<li>Without clear criteria for manageable workload per minimum time unit, we over-ambitiously added features requiring significant time to rescope relative to 4 weeks</li>
<li>Implemented transaction data, user returns and transaction data in CSR form difficult for search engines to index beyond charts</li>
<li>Without clear criteria for manageable workload per minimum time unit, we over-ambitiously added features requiring significant time to rescope relative to 4 weeks</li>
<li>Chart data and transaction data and user returns data are implemented in CSR form difficult for search engines to index beyond charts</li>
<li>We did not use state management libraries and experienced props drilling phenomenon where real-time price (currentPrice) goes deeply into child components</li>
<li>We implemented a 404 page to indicate incorrect access, but failed to separate pages that can only be accessed if a wallet is registered</li>
<li>We implemented server communication through HTTP requests and did not handle large-scale traffic</li>
</ol>
<h2>Future Action</h2>
<ol>
<li>As we progressed, we learned how to set the project duration appropriately and how to measure it, which is an important part of the project. It was valuable to set CPM from the beginning of the project and share progress evaluations to reach an agreement on the project's progress.</li>
<li>We need to implement SSR through NEXTJS to achieve SEO and create a web service that can be exposed to users.</li>
<li>To find an efficient component structure, we need to consider using state management libraries like Redux, Mobx, Recoil and React's composition, context, and portal to optimize data flow.</li>
<li>We need to refactor the web service to be a secure web service that can only be accessed if a wallet is registered by implementing a button that can only be viewed if a wallet is registered.</li>
<li>We need to apply a real-time data-linked web socket based on feedback on data processing.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Technical Problem Solving</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There was an issue with <strong>rendering optimization</strong>. <strong>3 days before project completion</strong>, we observed <strong>exponential growth in data requests</strong> for real-time charts during token diversification. <strong>The web became increasingly heavy over time, DB capacity grew infinitely, and the chain network consumed 8G of capacity within hours.</strong> We considered using <strong>useMemo</strong> to avoid rendering the same content or <strong>Redux</strong> for global state management to minimize rendering, but first checked all <strong>useEffect dependencies</strong> in existing code. Chart data, real-time data, and the process of accumulating real-time data into chart arrays after a certain time period had all their <strong>element values</strong> in useEffect dependencies. In other words, <strong>re-rendering occurred in all related components whenever functions and arrays included in charts changed</strong>. The exponential re-rendering issue was resolved by applying <strong>asynchronous processing at intervals matching random number generation periods</strong> to those dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working on the <strong>candlestick chart</strong> without understanding <strong>scroll events</strong> led to difficulties with <strong>scroll value conflicts</strong> between the chart and other pages, and obtaining <strong>mouse pointer values</strong>. We needed to distinguish between input values for the chart component and main page, and thought we needed to work on <strong>restricting and unrestricting scrolling</strong>. Searching these keywords, we learned we could <strong>isolate document.body.style.overflow values between unset and hidden</strong>, resolving the issue of main page scrolling affecting the chart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After setting price height and volume height values through <strong>SVG</strong>, we faced challenges showing values <strong>proportional to mouse pointer position</strong>. While we confirmed values matched precisely to two decimal places, days later those values had become <strong>negative</strong>. Upon review, we realized chart position values <strong>increase upward</strong> while mouse position values <strong>increase downward</strong>, causing value inversion and negative output issues. While we could find exact values using <strong>equations</strong>, we had applied incorrect formulas and set identical element values without considering <strong>differences between chart and volume values</strong>. We resolved the error by understanding that while <strong>candles can have different max and min values</strong>, <strong>volume has a fixed minimum of 0</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>At the end of the project</h3>
<p>I hope to implement SSR through NEXTjs to achieve SEO.</p>
<p>In addition to implementing the chart data logic on the server, I also failed to take on the role of the backend and contract parts in the future solo project.</p>
